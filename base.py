#Create the basic version of the game. The computer chooses a random number, and players guess until they get it right.
#Add tension: a 5-guess limit and Hot/Warm/Cold hints
#Upgrade the game with three difficulty modes. Each diffcuty expands the range of the secret number.
#Challenge your players by adding scoring. Keep track of how long a player takes and reward faster guesses with more points.
#Build a small leaderboard that saves each player’s name and score to a file. The game now remembers every victory, a big moment for the studio’s newest developers.
